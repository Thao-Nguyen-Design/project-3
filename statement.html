      Books. To many people, they are ink on paper. To me, they are awaiting adventures that need to be embarked, stories that need to be told and realities that need to be discovered.
      <br>

      Whenever the world crashes above me, I found serenity in books. Between the pages, I can be anyone I want to be, and go anywhere I want to go. In the fictional world, I feel the most alive, more than I have ever felt anywhere else.
      <br>
      <br>

      <i>Between the Pages</i> is a project where I symbolize the image of book as a portal into another world. The 3D models are created using Blender, and then put on the web with HTML/CSS. In addition to animation, the site employed TrackballControls from three.js, which let the users zoom, pan and rotate around the models with their mouse.
